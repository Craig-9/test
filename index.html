    <h3> About Me </h3>

    <p> I am a senior at oakland University studying Information Technology. I am 22 years old and from Warren, Michigan. I've always had a passion for technology and given a lot of time in learning more about it over the years. Currently I am working at an IT helpdesk where I assist people by troubleshooting different technology issues. Before here I worked as an IT intern at a company called Healthmetryx. Here I worked with a team and found solutions for different technical problems. In the future I'd like to become a cybersecurity analyst.  If you'd like to know more about me check out my <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/assignments/craiglippett_HW1TH_CSI3150_FS2023/html/resume.html">resume</a> and <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/assignments/craiglippett_HW1TH_CSI3150_FS2023/html/funfacts.html">fun facts</a> </p>
